# 5Letter-SpringBoot-App
 Spring Boot Version from scratch

Start date: OCTOBER 2021

### Progress 3/25/22:
After practicing a lot with the Twitter project. I decided to jump on this again. It took me a while to understand how to use DTO vs Sessions. But after playing around and looking at other code, I started to understand.

I then created a new list on things I need to work on as of today:

## Implementations and features
- [x] add level choice (27/3/22)
- [x] add name field for scoring purposes (27/3/22)
- [x] add score system (27/3/22)
- [x] implement hibernate JSP for processing and saving a score into a database (3/4/22)
  - this one was tricky. But I was looking at it the wrong way.
- [ ] add high-scores to view (top 5) - WIP (retrieving String[] empty List. Also, not able to start a new game now for some reason... - 3/4/22)

## Things to fix:
- [x] (D) fix the service tests
- [x] (B) FIX how to get the error to display on Thymeleaf? Code seems right... (28/3/22)
  - [x]  find a way to make the length error only show when there is something typed. And empty only when empty.
- [ ] (C) at the end: clean up all sessions requests into variables for readability
- [ ] (C) move all text to a property file for easy update and implementation
